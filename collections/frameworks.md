# Frameworks 

A collection of pretty neat dev frameworks.

## Node.js

Node.js is a JavaScript runtime environment - a platform to execute JavaScript codes on the server-side and make it portable.
In simple words: a runtime environment is where developers run a program.
But there are many frameworks written for Node.js:

- **[Express.js][5]** - fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js
- **[Nest.js][6]** - a progressive Node.js framework for building efficient, reliable and scalable server-side applications

## CSS

- **Carbon** by IBM - consisting of the [Carbon Design System][1] & its [Carbon Components][2] 
- **[Bootstrap][3]** - the worldâ€™s most popular framework for building responsive, mobile-first sites, with jsDelivr and a template starter page

## Mobile

- **[Cordova][4]** by Apache - mobile apps with HTML, CSS, JS with one source for all plattforms
