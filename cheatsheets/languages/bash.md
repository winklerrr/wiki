# Bash

Make sure to use the newest bash version for all the cool new features.
A good tutorial to update the current bash version can be found [here][tutorial].

## The Shebang

The first line of a script file which tells the computer how the script should be run is the so called "shebang" line:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
```

The recommended version of the shebang line looks like this:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
```

This line will make sure that also other bash installations on the system will be considered even if they are installed in another location different from `/bin/bash` (for example: when updating to a new bash version with Homebrew on macOS).

This allows the script to be executed in the following manner:

```bash
./script.sh
```

(The script needs to be marked as executable. Otherwise just call the interpreter directly: `bash script.sh`)

## Variables

In bash a variable can be declared like so:

```bash
my_var=value
```

The value is saved as a string.
To use the value of a given variable use `$` like so:

```bash
echo $my_var
```

## Functions

### Function Definition

A bash function can be defined with the keyword `function` before the function name or with parentheses after the function name:

```bash
function function_name {
  COMMADS
}

# or

function_name () {
  COMMANDS
}
```

### Function Arguments

- `$1`, `$2`, ..., `$n`: The passed arguments corresponding to the position of the argument after the functions name.
- `$0`: The function's name.
- `$#`: The number of arguments passed to the function.
- `$@`: All passed arguments. When double quoted `"$@"` expands to separate strings: `"$1" "$2" ... "$n"`.
- `$*`: All passed arguments. When double quoted `"$*"` expands to a single string: `"$1 $2 ... $n"`.
- `$?`: The exit status of the most recently run process.

## Condionals

The basic conditional structure looks like:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

var1="foo"

if [ "$var1" = "foo" ]; then
  echo "var1 == 'foo'"
else
  echo "var1 != 'foo'"
fi
```

The `if` keyword checks the exit status of a given command to determine the execution path.
The square brackets are needed because `"$var1" = "foo"` is not a command - it's just an expression.
By surrounding the expressing with square brackets the `test` command gets executed which then provides an exit status for the `if` keyword to check for.

Use double square brackets `[[ EXPRESSION ]]` for the updated `test` command.
For portability on POSIX systems stay with single square brackets.
